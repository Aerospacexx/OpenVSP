<p>OpenVSP is a parametric geometry tool for conceptual design. The
program is intended to be easy to use with intuitive graphical
interfaces that do not need much documentation. Historically, OpenVSP
had no in-program documentation.</p>
<p>There are certain areas where things get more complex and deep-dive
documentation is warranted. These in-program help files will be added as
needed, but this also presents an opportunity for users to
contribute.</p>
