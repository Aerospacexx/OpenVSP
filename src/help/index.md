# OpenVSP

OpenVSP is a parametric geometry tool for conceptual design.  The program is intended
to be easy to use with intuitive graphical interfaces that do not need much documentation.
Historically, OpenVSP had no in-program documentation.

There are certain areas where things get more complex and deep-dive documentation is
warranted.  These in-program help files will be added as needed, but this also presents an
opportunity for users to contribute.
